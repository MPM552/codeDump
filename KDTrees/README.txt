Assignment: CS315 Programming Assignment: K-D Tree
Purpose: The user first inputs the number of n parameters and p probes. Each 
parameter and probe has four data points w, x, y, and z. The parameters are 
then separated into buckets depending on the value and dimension of internal 
nodes. After the tree is made, the bucket that each probe would be placed 
in is visited and printed.  
 
Program Notes: To run the program with custom element and seed:
./randGen.pl seed range | ./kd elements probes 
Be sure that the number of elements is 0 or greater, otherwise the program
will not run. Same for the probes.
