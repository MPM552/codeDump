TEST DOCUMENT

This is the certified test document for project number 4 for the data 
structures and algorithms class taught my Dr. Finkel. It tests the 
ability of the program to correctly output data of more than just our
given text file. Since my program runs well with initial set of data,
I would hope it will do the same with this one. 

This project was a lot of fun and I look forward to learning more
about hashing.
